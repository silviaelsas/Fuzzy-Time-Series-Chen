# Fuzzy-Time-Series-Chen
Forecasting the future always has big impact on many fields. Among all of time series analysis methods, here I wrote codes in R language for Fuzzy Time Series Chen. 
There is package available in R for Chen method, but unfortunatenly I could not find a way to forecast one step ahead after the last record. So, I wrote this code to forecast one step period ahead. If any of you has something to tell me like the package to forecast one step period ahead using package, kindly just reach me out! Thanks in advance.
